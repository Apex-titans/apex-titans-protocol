# Apex Titans Protocol – Whitepaper v0.1.1

## Abstract
Apex Titans is a cross-chain ownership abstraction protocol that removes the need for bridges and wrapped tokens by allowing ownership proofs to move across chains while assets stay native.

## Problem
Bridges are insecure.
Wrapped tokens are IOUs.
Retail users lose funds.

## Solution
- Assets never move
- Proofs move
- No trusted relayers
- No bridges

## Protocol Layers
1. Ownership Proof Layer
2. Verification Layer
3. Validator Layer
4. Governance Layer

## Token
Name: Apex Titans
Symbol: ATS
Supply: 5,000,000 (fixed)

## Status
Research only. No token sale. No promises.

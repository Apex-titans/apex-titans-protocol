# Apex Titans Protocol Architecture (ATS)

## Goal
Enable cross-chain usage without bridges or wrapped tokens by moving *ownership proofs*, not assets.

## High-level Flow
1. User “anchors” an asset/position on the source chain.
2. Protocol records an ownership-proof commitment (hash) on-chain.
3. The same proof can be presented on any supported chain.
4. A verifier checks the proof and marks it as usable (prevents replay).
5. Validators stake ATS and can be slashed for incorrect verification (future phase).

## Components

### A) OwnershipProofRegistry (Source chain)
- Stores proof commitments (hashes) created by users.
- Emits events for off-chain indexing and cross-chain tracking.
- No bridging, no minting.

### B) ProofVerifier (Destination chain)
- Verifies that a proof commitment exists.
- Prevents replay (same proof used twice).
- In v0.x, verification is “registry-based” (demo).
- In later versions, upgraded to light-client / ZK verification.

### C) ValidatorStaking + Slashing (Phase 2)
- Validators stake ATS to participate.
- Wrong verification → slash.
- Rewards come from protocol fees (no inflation).

### D) Governance (Phase 2+)
- ATS holders vote on supported chains, parameters, upgrades.

## Security Principles
- No bridges
- No wrapped tokens
- No admin minting
- Immutable core contracts (upgrade only via governance later)
- Replay protection

## Current Scope (v0.1.x)
- Proof commitment registry + verifier demo on testnet
- Documentation and public releases

# Apex Titans Protocol (ATS)

Apex Titans is a cross-chain ownership abstraction protocol designed to solve one of crypto’s biggest unsolved problems: insecure bridges and fake wrapped tokens.

Mission:
To allow users to use their assets across multiple blockchains without moving them, bridging them, or wrapping them.

Token:
Name: Apex Titans
Symbol: ATS
Total Supply: 5,000,000 (Fixed, no minting)

Current Status:
Version 0.1 – Research & Testnet Phase

Core Principles:
- No bridges
- No wrapped tokens
- Assets never move between chains
- Ownership proofs instead of transfers
- Retail-first security
- Fully open-source

Roadmap:
Phase 1: Ownership proof demo (testnet)
Phase 2: Validator staking + slashing
Phase 3: Cross-chain verification layer
Phase 4: Full chain abstraction

This project is currently in public research and development.
No token sale. No mainnet token. No financial promises.
